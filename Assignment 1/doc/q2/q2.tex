\section{Introduction}
Nmap is a free and open source utility for network exploration and security auditing. It is primarily used for probing networks to reveal the active hosts and discover the ports and services that the hosts respond to. 
\paragraph{}
In this assignment we created a script to monitor a local subnet and track the number of hosts up at different points in time. We also ran nmap by itself on the local subnet to identify different hosts and services running.

\section{Number of Hosts}
The number of hosts was found to vary between 0 and 35. At nights, because of the LAN ban the number of hosts decreased significantly. Some hosts which are still up could be routers or mis-configured hosts. A graph is provided which plots the time dependence of the number of hosts. The median number of hosts is 17.

\section{Gateways and DNS Servers}

The DNS Servers \textbf{10.10.1.2 and 10.10.2.2}, are used in IIT Delhi for serving DNS requests of users. Many users also use external DNS servers like Google's 8.8.8.8 for their DNS needs.\\

The gateways are different for each area and I didn't find any list of them all. For my hostel (Jwalamukhi) the LAN gateways seem to be \textbf{10.254.203.6 and 10.254.203.2}. \\

For Vision Lab in Bharti Building, the gateways are \textbf{10.254.208.2 and 10.254.208.6}.
